This project implements a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).

It is submitted as part of the coursework for the Evolutionary Computation subject in the Masterâ€™s program in Artificial
Intelligence Research at UNED.

The primary objective of this task is to gain a deeper understanding of how Genetic Algorithms function, the various steps
involved, and how hyperparameters (e.g., crossover probability and mutation probability) influence both in the convergence
and the quality of the solution.

The file constants.py allows users to modify the hyperparameter values and adjust the distribution of cities within the
search area.
